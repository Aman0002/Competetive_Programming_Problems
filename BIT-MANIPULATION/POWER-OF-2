Given a positive integer N. The task is to check if N is a power of 2. More formally, check if N can be expressed as 2x for some x.
 

Example 1:

Input: N = 1
Output: true
Explanation: 1 is equal to 2 raised to 0 (20 == 1).
Example 2:

Input: N = 98
Output: false
Explanation: 
98 cannot be obtained by any power of 2.

Your Task: Your task is to complete the function isPowerofTwo() which takes n as a parameter and returns true or false by checking is given number can be represented as a power of two or not.

Expected Time Complexity: O(log N).
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(1).

Constraints:
0 <= N <= 1018
*/

bool isPowerofTwo(long long n){
    
    // Your code here  
    int cnt = 0;
    for (int i=0 ;i <=63 ;i++)
    {
        int z = n>>i & 1;
        if (z==1)
        cnt++;
    }
   
    if (cnt==1)
    return true;
    else
    return false;
}
